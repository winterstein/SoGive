				<H2>Director of SoGive</H2>
				<H3>About SoGive</H3>
				<span class="font-18 black-font">
					SoGive is a volunteer-driven organisation which <b>analyses charities</b> and makes that analysis freely available on our website. Our mission is to help donors do more good with their donations.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our analytical method involves applying what we call the <b>SoGive two-question method</b>, a charity analysis approach which focuses on cost-effectiveness.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our approach has similarities with that followed by charity analysis organisations like GiveWell and Founders Pledge.
					<br>
					<br>
					We differentiate by applying a rating to a <b>very broad range</b> of charities, covering almost all of the large charities in the UK, many small charities and several internationally.
					<br>
					<br>
					We currently move over <b>£1m</b> pa, most of which comes from a very small number of major donors. We also provide some support to fundraising events. We plan to grow this donor base.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our <b>key priorities</b> for the next 12 months are transforming our website, continuing to expand our (already substantial) analysis of charities, reaching more donors, and continuing to strengthen our team of volunteer analysts.
